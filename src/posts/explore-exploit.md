## Discounted WeWork Membership

*Explore*: Using a VPN and a web browser, refresh the [WeWork All Access](https://www.wework.com/solutions/wework-all-access) pricing page with different country IPs to discover the pricing discreprencies between currencies that can be charged for membership.

*Exploit*: If you are near a WeWork in a country that offers a cheaper subscription than elsewhere, sign up for the membership and pick up your badge. Or travel to a country that offers a competitive rate (calculate if this trip would be worth it over the duration you keep the membership).
